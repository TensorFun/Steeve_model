It takes information and analytics. As Monsanto tackles its mission to feed a growing world, the engineers at Monsanto play a critical role in building the data and software systems that power everything from DNA analysis to IoT-enabled farming to customer facing websites. Just as Monsanto supports farmers in growing more food with fewer resources, engineers in the newly formed Automation Engineering team partner with developers across IT to automate existing processes and champion the culture of Agile and DevOps. We operate across a wide gamut of disciplines including cloud infrastructure, security, identity management, developer productivity, IoT, analytics, and more. Our long term goal is to develop self-service, higher order solutions to exponentially increase our ability to deliver new software. An ideal candidate possesses broad, up-to-date technical skills across the core domains of software and IT infrastructure. At this level, they have become proficient with all aspects of the software development process (Agile planning, testing, development, performance optimization, refactoring, debugging, production support), and all components of software delivery (infrastructure, networking, operating systems, middleware, application runtimes, service integration, data and databases, production monitoring). They are also our experts in programming languages, algorithms and data structures, distributed computing and multi-threading, distributed databases, fault-tolerance, relational and non-relational data modeling and other advanced topics that power modern applications. Monsanto IT hires curious, self-directed learners who keep these skills up to date with the latest technologies. Our engineers are expert problem solvers who can be successful even with complex and high-uncertainty challenges. They are excellent communicators who persuasively promote innovative new approaches that bring value to their customers. Monsanto is committed to contributing back, both by contributing to open-source projects and through our own projects at http://github.com/MonsantoCo.
